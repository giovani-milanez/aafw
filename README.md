Attribute Authority Framework

This project is the result of my final paper.

The X.509 attribute certificate is a digitally signed document that establish
assignments to a entity. In July 2012, the technology was standardized
for use in Brazil by ICP-Brasil. Because it is a relatively new technology in that
country, the development support for systems that uses attribute certificate still
lack of studies and references. The author proposes a request-response protocol
for attribute certificate issuance, search and revocation. Such protocol was
implemented in a object oriented framework that allows the construction of applications
that need to manage the life cycle of that certificates. The framework
was used to build a prototype application for cinema ticket management.
